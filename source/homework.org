- In lesson 1, you had tried drawing different shapes using code.
- Mary has been experimenting with pyGame at home, and added these lines of code:
- *NOTE:* The first 4 lines are comments that explain how the shapes are drawn
- *NOTE:* Remember that you can always re-visit the week 1 notes for a reminder of how the code works.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # pygame.draw.rect(screen, colour, (x, y, width, height), thickness)
    # thickness is optional filled shape if specified
    # pygame.draw.circle(screen, colour, (x, y), radius, thickness)
    # pygame.draw.line(screen, colour, (startX, startY), (endX, endY), thickness)
    
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, white, (100, 100, 100, 40))    
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, white, (125, 140, 50, 50))
    pygame.draw.line(screen, white, (100, 80), (200, 80), 2)
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, white, (150, 50), 10, 2)

- Sketch out the shape that is drawn onto the screen when the code runs. The first is done for you. 
[[./img/w1hwk.jpg]]
- The first shape is a rectangle, which starts being drawn from x=100, y=100.
- The size of the rectangle is 100 pixels wide and 40 pixels tall. 
- To complete the task, you can use MS Paint, an app or complete the task on paper and photograph it with a phone.
- Upload the finished sketch to the first homework upload slot at www.BourneToLearn.com
